Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Coin2Fly Core

 This package provides the daemon, coin2flyd, and the CLI tool
 coin2fly-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Coin2Fly is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Coin2Fly uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Coin2Fly Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides coin2fly-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a coin2fly daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
